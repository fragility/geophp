GeoPHP is a library that is intended to hold and process GIS data conforming
to the OGC Simple Features for SQL specification.  For information see 
http://www.opengis.org/docs/99-049.pdf.  Data in this format is used by the
PostGIS extension to PostgreSQL and the Spatial Extensions for MySQL.  This

advanced processing capabilities such as projections and relationships.
